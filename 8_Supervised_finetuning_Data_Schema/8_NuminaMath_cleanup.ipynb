It then takes the direction back to reach the main road.\\n\\nWhen the first car takes a right turn and then a left turn, it forms a right-angled triangle with the main road. The distance it travels away from the main road (the 15 km) will not affect the distance between the two cars along the main road. So, we can ignore the 15 km for now.\\n\\nThe first car travels a total of 25 km + 25 km = 50 km along directions that are parallel to the main road before heading back towards it.\\n\\nThe second car, due to a breakdown, has only managed to travel 35 km along the main road.\\n\\nNow, let's calculate the distance between the two cars along the main road:\\n\\nThe initial distance between the two cars was 150 km. The first car has covered 50 km of this distance, and the second car has covered 35 km.\\n\\nDistance remaining between the two cars along the main road = Initial distance - (Distance covered by first car + Distance covered by second car)\\nDistance remaining = 150 km - (50 km + 35 km)\\nDistance remaining = 150 km - 85 km\\nDistance remaining = 65 km\\n\\nTherefore, the distance between the two cars along the main road is $\\\\boxed{65}$  km.\"}\n"
